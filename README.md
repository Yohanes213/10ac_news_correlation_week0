## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing news data to uncover insights such as top news websites, traffic analysis, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and more. The dataset includes information about news articles, including source, author, content, sentiment, and publication date. By leveraging various data science techniques, we aim to gain actionable insights into the news landscape.

## Task Overview

The project is divided into multiple tasks:

1. **Project Setup and EDA**: Setup Python environment, perform exploratory data analysis, and answer specific questions about the data.
2. **Data Science Component Building**: Develop components for machine learning operations (MLOps), conduct time series analysis, classification of headlines, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling.
3. **PostgreSQL**: Design database schema, load data into PostgreSQL, and utilize it for storing ML features.
4. **Dashboards**: Design and implement a dashboard using Streamlit or React to visualize analysis results.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the project using GitHub Actions for continuous deployment, and configure environment variables and PostgreSQL database.

## Task 1: Project Setup and EDA

- **Git and GitHub Setup**: Created a GitHub repository and set up version control.
- **Python Environment Setup**: Prepared a Python environment for data analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the dataset to answer various questions about news articles, including top websites, traffic analysis, sentiment analysis, and more.
